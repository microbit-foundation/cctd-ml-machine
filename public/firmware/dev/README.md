## Dev firmware

These are firmware files used for debugging and development. These are not intended to be available to regular users.

Be warned that these may not always be up-to-date feature wise, and may need to be updated when new features are added to the hex files.

#### Outdated firmware
To test the outdated firmware warning, we have outdated firmware versions. These should be the same as the currently available hex, but with wrong/no version numbers announced.
